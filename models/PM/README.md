Coordinates for the two main TM representations RH1 (interacting through the G545-G549 motif) and RH2 (interacting mainly through a mix of A544-G548 and G545-G549 motifs) in a PM-like membrane.
The composition of the PM-like membrane was defined based on the recent article from Ingolfsson et al. , J. Phys Chem. B, 2020 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c03368)
